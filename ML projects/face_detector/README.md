# Face detection with CNN

## About the Project

Simple pipeline to create face detection model that can be useful in adding photo filters.

## About dataset 

The dataset contains over 15K images of 20 people (6 females and 14 males - 4 people were recorded twice).
or each frame, a depth image, the corresponding rgb image (both 640x480 pixels), 
and the annotation is provided. The head pose range covers about +-75 degrees yaw and +-60 degrees pitch. 
Ground truth is provided in the form of the 3D location of the head and its rotation.
