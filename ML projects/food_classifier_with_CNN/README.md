# Food classifier with CNN

## About the Project

Imagine that we create a method used to track a person's nutrition. 
With each meal, it is supposed to take a photo of the dish. 
One of its functions is to make sure that the user 
does not start eating too much junk food and here we need help!

The task sounds simple. However, what to do if the data is not enough?

Deep learning offers ways to deal with these types of problems. 
My attempt to solve this task was based on several of them. 
Namely, pretrained-model and transfer learning. 
With their help, I was able to teach the model with 82% accuracy.

I believe that it is possible to train the model for this task 
with much greater accuracy. However, this is my first deep learning project 
and I still miss a lot to be a specialist.

## Scraping images
Before starting the project use functions.my_scraper.py function 
to download photos (images will be stored in the 'data_food_classifier_MG' directory).

If you have no idea about the meals you want to download, 
call the function without arguments. 
I have prepared the appropriate search terms as default parameters.



## Jupyter Installation
You can find the installation documentation for the
[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found
[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For a local installation, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

    $ pip install notebook




## Python & Required Libraries
Of course, you obviously need Python. Python 3 is already preinstalled on many systems nowadays. 
You can check which version you have by typing the following command (you may need to replace `python3` with `python`):

    $ python3 --version  # for Python 3

Any Python 3 version should be fine, preferably 3.5 or above. 
If you don't have Python 3, I recommend installing it. 
To do so, you have several options: on Windows or MacOSX, you can just download it from 
[python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). On MacOSX, you can alternatively use 
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). 
If you are using Python 3.6 on MacOSX, you need to run the following command 
to install the `certifi` package of certificates because Python 3.6 on MacOSX has no certificates to validate 
SSL connections (see this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27835619/urllib-and-ssl-certificate-verify-failed-error)):

    $ /Applications/Python\ 3.6/Install\ Certificates.command

On Linux, unless you know what you are doing, you should use your system's packaging system. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu, type:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

Another option is to download and install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). This is a package that includes both Python and many scientific libraries. You should prefer the Python 3 version.

If you choose to use Anaconda, read the next section, or else jump to the [Using pip](#using-pip) section.

## Using Anaconda
Once you have [installed Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) (or Miniconda), you can run the following command:

    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    
This will give you a conda environment named `mlbook`, ready to use! Just activate it and you will have everything setup
for you:

    $ conda activate mlbook

You are all set! Next, jump to the [Starting Jupyter](#starting-jupyter) section.

## Using pip 
If you are not using Anaconda, you need to install several scientific Python libraries that are necessary for this project, in particular NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Jupyter and TensorFlow (and a few others). For this, you can either use Python's integrated packaging system, pip, or you may prefer to use your system's own packaging system (if available, e.g. on Linux, or on MacOSX when using MacPorts or Homebrew). The advantage of using pip is that it is easy to create multiple isolated Python environments with different libraries and different library versions (e.g. one environment for each project). The advantage of using your system's packaging system is that there is less risk of having conflicts between your Python libraries and your system's other packages. Since I have many projects with different library requirements, I prefer to use pip with isolated environments. Moreover, the pip packages are usually the most recent ones available, while Anaconda and system packages often lag behind a bit.

These are the commands you need to type in a terminal if you want to use pip to install the required libraries. Note: in all the following commands, if you chose to use Python 2 rather than Python 3, you must replace `pip3` with `pip`, and `python3` with `python`.

First you need to make sure you have the latest version of pip installed:

    $ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip

The `--user` option will install the latest version of pip only for the current user. If you prefer to install it system wide (i.e. for all users), you must have administrator rights (e.g. use `sudo python3` instead of `python3` on Linux), and you should remove the `--user` option. The same is true of the command below that uses the `--user` option.

Next, you can optionally create an isolated environment. This is recommended as it makes it possible to have a different environment for each project (e.g. one for this project), with potentially very different libraries, and different versions:

    $ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade virtualenv
    $ python3 -m virtualenv -p `which python3` env

This creates a new directory called `env` in the current directory, containing an isolated Python environment based on Python 3. If you installed multiple versions of Python 3 on your system, you can replace `` `which python3` `` with the path to the Python executable you prefer to use.

Now you must activate this environment. You will need to run this command every time you want to use this environment.

    $ source ./env/bin/activate

On Windows, the command is slightly different:

    $ .\env\Scripts\activate

Next, use pip to install the required python packages. If you are not using virtualenv, you should add the `--user` option (alternatively you could install the libraries system-wide, but this will probably require administrator rights, e.g. using `sudo pip3` instead of `pip3` on Linux).

    $ python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

Great! You're all set, you just need to start Jupyter now.

## Starting Jupyter
Okay! You can now start Jupyter, simply type:

    $ jupyter notebook

This should open up your browser, and you should see Jupyter's tree view, with the contents of the current directory. If your browser does not open automatically, visit [127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree). Click on `index.ipynb` to get started!

Congrats! You are ready to use my food classifier!
