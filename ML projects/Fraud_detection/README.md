# Fraud detection with imbalanced data

## About the Project

Detection of fraud is a very important part of data analysis,
data which in such situations are very unbalanced.

I have tried to combine several approaches to this problem and create
one coherent model that will detect credit card frauds. 
After a deeper analysis, the combination of random forest, 
gradient boosting and isolation forest worked best.

I only used 25% of the original data. Links to data sets below:

The notebook is constructed in such a way 
that it implicitly uses the models I have trained. 
If you want to teach your own models, 
throw the selected models yourself from the 'models' folder.
